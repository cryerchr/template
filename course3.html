			<h1>Course Retrospective Essay</h1>
			<p>To begin the term we composed essays off of a lived experience that we have 
all dealt with. I wrote mine on my mission trips to the poverty-stricken city of 
Guatemala. This was my favorite assignment out of all of them because I was able to write 
about something I am extremely passionate about. Caring so much about this assignment 
caused me to do very well on it. I was able to explain the meaning of my trip, the impact 
it had on my life, and I also got to share it with others. I felt this assignment was so 
important because what we do in Guatemala should be spread across the world, so that so 
many more people can do the same as I have. I tried to express my excitement and passion 
for my trips in my writing by giving examples of what we did there and how they directly 
correlated with my life today.</p>
			<p>At times, I struggled with finding the words that I wanted to say on 
certain topics but I wouldn't have it any other way. This class is meant to challenge you. 
I look back to one assignment in particular, the Formal Research assignment. In this 
assignment I explored my major, and wrote on the literacy importance of that particular
 field. I am a business major, and literacy is a crucial aspect to being successful along 
with research. By saying this, I mean that the world and its business are always changing 
and the way you learn and diversify yourself to it is through research. Being a business
 major makes it necessary that I know this, so that I can learn how others do things and 
how to be as successful as possible. </p>
