			<h1>Life in the Lyris...</h1>
			<p>Each and everyday we are all surrounded by music. Music is played around us
			 constantly in our cars, on the streets, in stores, office buildings, and so 
			many others. People have always enjoyed listening to music while doing daily 
			activities and I think sometimes it’s easy to get caught up in what the artist
			 actually means through the lyrics. Think of that catchy tune that you heard 
			today; think of those lyrics. Do the lyrics represent who you are and or what 
			you stand for? In today’s society, music is huge. Music is a representation of 
			feelings, actions, and even some people decisions. People are driven on a 
			daily basis across the world to do things they wouldn't normally do by music. 
			Song lyrics can trigger people to do things that go against the “norm” of 
			society or their normal attitude towards life. When someone hears certain 
			lyrics in a song it can sometimes give them the attitude that if the lyrics 
			and artist say it’s okay to do, then, “it’s okay” right? I personally believe 
			that a lot of these against “norm” things people are doing caused by song 
			lyrics are based on the maturity level of each individual person. There has to 
			be another way to censor music without only using the parental advisory.</p>
			<p>Music is, always has been, and always will be, a huge part of my life. I 
			have an enormous appreciation level for the talent and hard work it takes to 
			create a lot of the music I listen to. Music influences my life in so many 
			ways and I truly believe music is a good thing for society. Music gives so 
			much joy to so many different kinds of people and in many ways brings people 
			together. Although I love good (clean/edited) music, I do still listen to some 
			pretty suggestive music at times. To be honest, my favorite artists are 
			rappers. I love the way rap music pumps you up for a game, gets you ready for 
			a big concert, and gives you that adrenaline rush before going out with your 
			friends. Even though I love rap music, I definitely feel like there needs to 
			be a high maturity level in the person listening to it. The suggestive things 
			these kinds of songs suggest people to do aren’t “acceptable” in society to 
			most, and you need to be mature enough to not feel pressured to do many of 
			them. We have left this decision in the hands of parents but it seems like 
			that really isn’t working. I don't know if it's the lack of parent 
			responsibility or kids going behind their parents back to get suggestive 
			music, but there is definitely a problem being seen. Society does a fair job 
			of censoring music but in no means is it perfect.</p>
			<p>This is an issue that I stand in the middle on. On one hand there is a good
			 influence through music and the joy it gives to people. On the other there 
			are bad influences that get people to do and say things that they normally 
			would not do if for the song or a certain lyric.</p>
