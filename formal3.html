			<h1>Formal Research Paper</h1>
			<p>My academic discipline and the one I have chose to write about is an 
applied sciences discipline, and more narrowly business. In the business world there are 
so many key and crucial aspects that can make you and your business more successful. There 
are many aspects that go into making a business successful, but I have learned that 
research and writing are two of the most important. Being able to research effectively 
and comprehend/produce proper writing is essential in any business. Without either of 
these two aspects, it is unlikely that a business will thrive in today’s continually 
changing business society. 
In the business world there are so many different and unique ways of doing things and 
getting something done. The way you learn and grow is by research and reading other types 
of ways to be successful. By researching, you can discover multiple ways, ideas, and 
opinions on how to do and get things done for your type of business that work both 
effectively and not. Research can give you insight on how to better your business, and run
 a successful company. In today’s types of businesses there are many different methods 
and also many different opinions on how things can be run and should be ran.</p>
