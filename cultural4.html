			<h1>Page 3</h1>
			<p>I listen to a lot of rap music including, Drake, Kanye West, and artists 
			like Justin Timberlake. All of these artists have had instances of trouble 
			with society and their decisions, but to me, that doesn't relate to the music 
			they make. Whatâ€™s said in a track is left on the track. If you like a song by 
			a certain artist, that is it. I don't listen to the criticism and the trouble 
			they get into in their everyday life. I do not feel like everyone in society 
			looks at it that way though.</p>
			<p>For example, say someone likes the music Lady Gaga makes or even Miley 
			Cyrus, does that mean they have to act like them or imitate them? No. This is 
			the line of maturity level I am talking about. Just because Miley Cyrus has a 
			popular single does that mean young teen girls need to go get tattoos or a 
			buzz cut? I don't believe so, and I put some of that directly on the impact 
			parents are leaving on their kids. My parents raised me to respect music but 
			to more importantly respect myself. Meaning, yes I do listen to suggestive 
			material but I deal with it in a way that it doesn't mold my life or my 
			decisions.</p>
