			<h1>Formal Research Paper</h1>
			<p>Other than storyboards marketers use writing in their demographics which 
are for those who don't know, statistical data relating to the population and particular 
groups within it. Demographics are how businesses and marketers find out how to bring 
their idea/ad to the public and also segment the population. They look something like 
this:</p>

/> </body>
			<p>In this example of a demographic it is talking about the Adult Homeless 
Health Services Program. The chart is showing the percentage of what race is involved. As 
you can see the majority of this “pie chart” is Caucasians, and the minority is people of 
ethnicities that happen to not be white, African American, Asian, or Hispanic.</p>
			<p>In an Advertising McGraw Hill textbook, there is an entire chapter dedicated
 to research and planning. The chapter specializes in how much research benefits 
businesses and their methodology they get from it. It says, “ Marketing research is the 
systematic gathering, recording, and analysis of information to help managers make marketing 
decisions.” And for advertising, “ it's the systematic gathering and analysis of 
information specifically to facilitate the development or evaluation of advertising 
strategies, ads and commercials, and media campaigns.” Although they have minor changes 
they share the same topic in general. Research helps make informed decisions. </p>
			<p>In the same McGraw Hill textbook it talks about copywriters who play a huge 
role in the planning step for marketers. It may be self-explanatory but copywriters are 
the people that write the copy. The copy is the words that make up the headline and 
message of an advertisement or commercial. The copy for marketers looks something like 
this:</p>
			<body> <img src="http://www.posters57.com/images/muhamad-ali.jpg" /> </body>
			<p>In this image the copy is the slogan. This is for Adidas Company and there 
slogan, “Impossible is nothing.” The copywriter’s job is to write that slogan and import 
it into the ad. It is not there job to tie it to a certain image; their job is to make a 
slogan that works well in representing the company.</p>
