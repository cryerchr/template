<p>Composing In Context</p>

<p>•	In this project we have a context base that is narrowly focused on sports in the 
college setting and how even with all of the positives may have a negative effect on the 
people and the students of universities. I never saw sports as an issue; I always looked 
at the positive in sports and how they impacted people. First, I want to start by saying 
that the meaning of our documentary was not to look down on sports, saying that, us three 
are huge sports fans. Our main goal is to get people to realize what sports due to the 
people and how it may negatively affect some.</p>

<p>Process</p>

<p/>•	We selected this topic because of all of our knowledge of sports and we did 
research. The research led us to conclusions that were completely different than the 
beliefs we had. The most challenging aspect to this project, in my mind would have to have 
been the interviews. By saying that I mean, not the interviews themselves but the 
arranging and the carrying through with them was the hardest part for me.</p>
<p>•	We took, in my mind, a very strategic and systematic approach. We started with the
 thesis of our argument, data to back it up, words from the public (with interviews). We 
formed it all together to come to the conclusion that we come forward with today. Which is 
that aside from the good of sports, in a college setting it gets put before the people in 
many different aspects.</p>

<p>Research</p>

<p>•	I would have to say we were more of an interview base on our research; we leaned 
on our sources and trusted them with the facts and numbers that we were tying to achieve. 
Research helped not only me but also all of us learn really about this issue.  We all are 
big fans of sports and what they stand for, and our research helped us see the other side 
of things and some of the negative affects of sports.</p>

<p>Collaboration</p>

<p>•	I loved the group that I chose to work with; we met together on many occasions, 
to first propose our idea, to set up interviews, and what not. We did run into a speed 
bump and had to switch themes of the project, but I believe it was all for the better. 
Since interviews fell through with our old idea, I was able to learn and do research on 
important facts. Also, in the mean time get to know my group members better and also the 
people we met in the process. I could have not came up with half as good of a project 
without my group, which needless to say, it was fruitful and very helpful to achieve 
success.</p>

<p>Project Management</p>

<p>•	At first the management was slow and not too par with where we needed it to be. 
After a week we collaborated in class and got it together and were on par with task and 
dates that we felt things should be done on. We held each other accountable for our work 
and that our fair share was in fact completed.</p>

<p>Documentary Design

<p>•	The most effective is the student that I meant through interviewing and how he has
 negative experiences due to athletics. Cause, before this I looked at sports as 
enjoyment, fun, and hope. Sports can get you through times, on professional and even 
collegiate levels. When we put the sports before the being in this setting that is when 
lines are crossed and it begins to create a unfair and an unlikable setting. Design came 
from Nick who was way more advanced than Ian and I. Nick was able to edited and design to 
do things exactly the way we all pictured them.</p>
