			<p>My first example of this comes from an artist named Drake in the song, The 
			Motto. In the song Drake says, “you only live once, that's the motto, yolo.” 
			At first I loved the song and the meaning behind it. I thought it stood for a 
			positive outlook on life; it really made me think. As I listened to it, I 
			realized that I really do only live once and I shouldn’t hold back in life, 
			but not in negative ways. The song got taken out of context as it became more 
			popular on many different occasions. People began doing dumb and outrageous 
			things. Many teens and college students started saying, “yolo” all the time 
			and it was impacting their decisions to do something rationally. Yolo became 
			a slang word through out teens and young adults when talking about things they
			 did that were “unlike” themselves. Sydney Lupkin of ABC says, “Young adults 
			tweet #YOLO when they don't study, get drunk or drive too fast.” She explains 
			this in her study on the implications of the hot phrase on our nation’s 
			impressionable young ones. There are different maturity levels in everyone; 
			nobody matures on the exact same day or year. Everyone matures at different 
			ages and times; this is the problem. Are people mature by the time their 
			legal? If not, how do you stop it?</p>
			<p>Yolo is not the only example by any means. Now-a-days, social media is huge 
			part of our society. It is one of the biggest and most important industries in 
			our world. One of the most popular apps in social media networking is VINE. 
			Since the song, “Bandz A Make Her Dance” came out, twerking (a suggestive 
			sexual dance move) has played a huge part in VINE. I haven’t gone a day 
			without seeing a video on VINE of someone twerking. Lisa Berkman of the 
			Huffington Post talks about society, twerking, and teens, all after Miley 
			Cyrus was non-stop twerking on stage during her live performance at this years 
			Video Music Award’s. Lisa goes on to say, “It’s your teenager’s job to upset 
			you. To push your buttons, society’s limits, and that metaphorical envelope. 
			They have so many ways to do this -- the way they dress, the language they use 
			-- but their tool of choice is most often their music.” Whether people believe 
			it or not, they act out on what they listen to or at least support it. All 
			because of a couple lyrics in a song twerking came alive. People see celebrity 
			icons like Miley Cyrus doing it and they want to imitate them on public social 
			media websites where we can all see it. Many people in our society look up to 
			celebrity music icons as role models, and when they support certain artists 
			they sometimes feel like if they do the same things or imitate the artist it 
			will make them more like the particular artist. It takes a certain maturity 
			level to know that you don’t need to do crazy outrageous things in life just 
			because you see an action or hear a certain lyric by an artist.</p>
