			<h1>Formal Research Paper</h1>
			<p>Research can come from so many different kinds of sources. It can come from 
the Internet, the community, suppliers and customers, books and newspapers, and so much 
more. The most successful companies are the ones using the most up to date research, and 
moving along with the path of updates in the newest technology of our society. Always 
looking for the newest and up to date research can make a big difference in your company 
compared to others. </p>
			<p>When someone chooses an academic discipline such as this, it really makes 
it hard not to do research on methods and others views. You cannot be close-minded while 
becoming a business major. To be successful you have to very open-minded in learning about 
new ideas and researching multiple point of views. Having a variety of up to date research
 ad combining them to create the greatest product ensures great success in the business 
field. </p>
			<p>First let me go in depth on what a business academic discipline necessarily 
looks like. It is a discipline that comes with rigorous course work and can vary through 
many different central topics based on the student’s interest. Personally, I have chosen 
to take the route that is centralized through marketing and advertising. I chose this 
because of my fathers business and the need of marketers to grow his business. I am open 
to taking in new ideas, combining what I see in thriving businesses together, using 
extreme amounts of research, and adding my own personal skills and creativity to my 
fathers business. If I can do this I will be able to share what I have learned to the 
marketing team, and I will help the business to continue to grow. Along with researching, 
writing is also another important factor in business. </p>
			<p>Writing is a huge part of the marketing side of business. You need to know 
how to write and research. Combining both research and writing can show just how strong of 
a business you have. You cannot have research without writing, nor writing without 
research in a thriving business setting. Writing is a good way of planning, processing 
thoughts, combing ideas, and physically being able to take your mental “notes” and put 
them down on paper (or computer, etc.). An example of this is storyboards, which are a 
key step in the advertising process. This provides the main purpose of the advertisement 
in a writing form.</p>
