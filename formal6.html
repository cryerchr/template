			<h1>Formal Research Paper</h1>
			<p>Last week I got the chance to sit down with my aunt, Rhonda Velders, who 
is a professor that specializes in advertising at a community college in Houston. As I was
 interviewing her I got to ask her all about research and writing and how it effects 
advertising, negatively and/ or positively. She had nothing negative to say about 
research. Velders states, “In advertising there is always competition, companies want to 
create the best ad for their company and will do whatever they can to achieve it. A step 
in the process of creating in ad uses research on what the people want, and how to market 
to those that they want to market to.” As I continued to listen to what she had to say and 
the emphasis she put on research confirmed in my mind on how important it really is. 
Chapter 1 of the Cengage Marketing textbook talks about business and the role research 
plays in the business world. It goes on to say how it is a decisive and an important 
factor in the business world. Its first example had to do with the business AFLAC; you 
know the popular duck, “AFLAAAAK!” AFLAC, like other firms, has faced important business 
decision about how to create brand awareness, how to build consumer knowledge of the 
brand, and how to build sales and loyalty. Saying this means the recent history of AFLAC 
demonstrates the need for information in making informed decisions addressing key issues 
faced by all competitive businesses. Research can provide that information. Without it, 
business decisions involving both tactics and strategies are made in the dark. Just like 
AFLAC, several businesses thrive off of research to make decisions not out of spite but 
out of knowledge and intelligence. 
	All examples for food companies, including restaurants and other chains have the same 
goal and objective when they research. The goal of their research, is to find out what 
the people want, and how they can provide it to them in a way the benefits them and also 
the public. In the Cengage textbook it says, “survey research suggests that consumers 
would respond favorably to food and drink products providing benefits that improve one’s 
ability to exercise.” Even though this example is specifically based towards food 
companies, I think this is something I want to specifically focus on in my own business. 
Making the customer happy is a huge part of business. Doing the correct research on what 
the people want will help to bring in more revenue and better my business.
	On Friday I was able to conduct an interview with a business owner. Robert Cryer, the 
owner of Chemco Products Inc. He shed some light on the importance of research in his 
business. In further detail he runs a water treatment facility that is very competitive in
 mid Michigan. His company has been growing in sales every year since it’s opening. I 
started off by asking how they continue to raise sales and income through a recession. He 
states, “ Competition is the driving force to keep improving and staying one tier above 
the next.” Ironically before he knew this interview had a central topic of research he 
says, “ On a daily basis my co-workers and I research and study ways of promoting 
ourselves and also how my company can best fit the standards of our clients along with 
us.”
	A follow up to my interview with Mr. Cryer, him and his business have stayed in touch 
with me not because I am his son but in more of a professional sense. He told me to 
remember to always use correct and informational sources when researching for your 
business. This is important because there are a lot of misleading and false truths in the 
business. Also, the place where you learn to research and write correctly starts with the 
discipline. 
	After conducting these interviews, reading online sources, and even textbooks, I have
 come to the conclusion research plays key roles not only in academic discipline business
 but in the actual business world. Many may come into college thinking research papers 
will be the last time they have or need to do research, but it’s not. Yes, you can skate
 by okay without research, but the key point is that it is crucial to success. No matter
 how old you are or if you are the greatest business owner in the world, you will always
 need to know how to properly research and write. I believe not only in business but also
 in any academic discipline or career! </p>
