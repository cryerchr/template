			<h1>Page 4</h1>
			<p>We are all surrounded by music in our everyday lives. Music has always 
			played a huge role in my life. I don't listen to the cleanest music by any 
			means but I feel like I handle the lyrics and the message a little bit better 
			then others in our society. Music inspires people and makes you feel certain 
			ways, but it doesn’t always have a positive outlook on your life. As I stated 
			many times, music changes the actions and decisions of people in both positive 
			and negative ways, but mostly negative in our society. It comes from that 
			maturity level that I talked about earlier. You never truly know when someone 
			matures, and if they are grown up enough to listen to suggestive material. 
			I stand in the middle because of the way I view music and lyrics is positive, 
			but it gives out a misconception on the life of so many others. YOLO, Miley 
			Cyrus, and Lady Gaga are just three examples of many instances where music 
			lyrics and the meanings behind songs get blown out of proportion and are over 
			used in negative ways. The lyrics based around “twerking” and “yolo” were 
			never to be negative, but the large amounts of immature people take it and 
			turn it into something suggestive. All in all there will always be music and 
			it will always be a booming industry. Our society needs to find a better 
			method of censoring music so those that are immature cant turn non-suggestive 
			material into something negative, as well suggestive material, and how it 
			shouldn't be misused and taken out of context.</p>
