		<p>The name of this class is Science and Technology, and ironically, it is exactly 
		what opened my eyes to what I am going to do with my life.</p>
		<p>This past summer I had the opportunity to take a life-changing trip to a less 
		fortunate country than ours, Guatemala. Traveling to this country really made me 
		get a grasp on life and what is most meaningful to me. Working with and helping 
		the people of Guatemala made me realize that I wanted to continue this type of 
		work for the rest of my life.</p>
		<p>I was brought to this amazing opportunity by a medium inscribed on the 
		Internet, which only seems fitting to this class and more specifically this essay. 
		One day as I was browsing the Internet I ran across a website called 
		foreverchanged- international.org/ and instantly took interest in it. As I read 
		more and more about this orphanage I couldn’t help but think about what my parents 
		have always taught me and realized this would be an amazing adventure. I would be 
		rewarded in ways far greater than the rewards for doing things for myself. This 
		trip would leave a lasting impact on my life and the way I would choose to live my 
		life from there on out.</p>
		<p>Its surreal for many to think that in just four short years you could be doing 
		the same thing for the rest of your life or at least have an idea in mind. In my 
		opinion, I see the next four years as the determination and ambition to do what I 
		love. College has already given me a positive outlook on life and the world. In my 
		first week as a college freshman I already have a clear idea of what I am going to 
		do not only for myself, but also for others that may be in need of my help. I want 
		to be able to help both people far and near from me. Even the people that are so 
		far way are so close to my heart.</p>
		<p>I have been so fortunate to be blessed into a family that allows me to pursue 
		my dreams, but also a family that reminds me that my dreams should touch others 
		not just myself. I was raised in a Christian household where the idea of “giving 
		and receiving” was one of the most important parts of life. I have always been the 
		type of person to give money to the homeless, pray for the people less fortunate 
		than me at church, and do “good deeds” as any Christian should, but I will never 
		be able to explain the impact Guatemala had on me. This trip taught me more than 
		anything what is most important in life is the giving of myself to others. I will 
		no longer just reach out with materialistic things, but with my faith and love for 
		others within myself.</p>
		<p>Nine months after taking this trip, I can clearly see how much I have changed 
		and how much the Guatemalan people have impacted my life. Doing hard work and 
		giving clean water to people less fortunate than me gives no greater reward 
		imaginable. To see the priceless smiles on the faces of the needy makes any amount 
		of hard work so much more rewarding. In brief words I can describe the lasting 
		impact the trip had on my life, my heart, and me. I can undoubtedly tell you that 
		the told me what career field to go into. Traveling to Guatemala put a special 
		place in my heart for the Guatemalan people and also other parts of the world 
		struggling at the same level of poverty that need my help.</p>
		<p>Living in a poverty-stricken area like Guatemala for only one week was 
		incredible and also frightening at the same time. Seeing how so many people could 
		live in such harsh conditions was hard for me, but I knew in my heart God had a 
		plan for these people and had reasoning behind me being there. A trip like that 
		brings you down to earth and really sets things into perspective.</p>
		<p>Now that I am a college freshman, I realize the importance of technology as 
		well as how much success comes from technology in present time. The career field 
		I am planning to go into is business. I plan to form a small business, where I 
		will team with professional and amateur sport teams. After teaming up with them I 
		plan to make company partners with each team. I will market each team, and some of 
		the revenue will go directly to mission teams and also to the people at Forever 
		Changed International Orphanage. I want there to always be good and quality care 
		for orphans. As long as our world continues to produce, there will always be more 
		orphans in the world. It is hard for me to know that the number of orphans in the 
		world is most likely going to continue to rise, but I am going to try with all my 
		power to help as much as I can.</p>
		<p>Orphans have always had a special place in my heart because of many personal 
		reasons. Those close to me have adopted and helped the cause but have not even put 
		a dent in the number of orphans still out there. I plan to do whatever I can to 
		give to those in need, everything they need. I want a job that creates enough 
		capital to directly impact those in need and also enough to support the people 
		around me along with myself first hand.</p>
		<p>Now that you know the reasoning for wanting to specialize in small business, I 
		can describe exactly what I want to do with my company. My plan is to open my own 
		firm of marketers and agents for professional athletes and teams. It will take a 
		lot of knowledge and technology to reach my goal but I know I can do it. In the 
		marketing and agency field I will be required to have capital, making it possible 
		for me to bring in more. I have always wanted to do something like this since I 
		can remember. Some of my most life impacting passions include all kinds of sports 
		that almost all Americans love. This includes sports such as basketball, baseball, 
		and football. My profession would allow all of my passions to become reality in my 
		everyday life.  I would be able to be passionate in the workplace and also when I 
		come home to my wife and kids. It is needless to say that I will need capital to do 
		things for those that are unable to support themselves.</p>
		<p>This connects to the essay and more importantly the class because to be 
		successful in my life and career technology will be a huge factor. I will need to 
		know how to set up sites as well as learning how to stay updated with current 
		technology. Without knowledge of the “tech society” I would get left behind in my 
		work environment. I need to always stay up to date with technology and the 
		newest/latest ways of communication. My dreams and aspirations are so important to 
		me that I know I need to stay into technology, but to first learn it. </p>
		<p>My goal in taking this class is to improve my knowledge of technology, along 
		with improving the writing skills that will always be crucial in life. Up to this 
		point in my life I have been up to date with the technology of our world, but in 
		aspects such as web design and others of that category, I am a little behind. With 
		the help of class mates and more importantly the professor, this class will make 
		me stronger in the field at which will be a medium to my business and in a bigger 
		aspect my whole life.</p>
		<p>Who would have thought my trip to Guatemala would shape and mold my entire 
		life? I wouldn’t have had it any other way because it gave me an outlook on life 
		that is far greater than my needs for myself. I can fit all of my passions into 
		the same lifestyle, and that is something I feel safe to say does not happen to 
		often. I feel very blessed to have had this occur in my life and to have parents 
		who have taught me what is most important in life. My experience in Guatemala 
		aspired me to go after the career field I have always dreamed of, business and 
		sports management. I have seen people live in the hardest of conditions and have 
		watched them continue on living life to the fullest each and everyday. Nothing in 
		life will stop me from reaching my goal. I will never forget how important it is 
		to give back with myself through out the rest of my life. I will work hard to be 
		able to give as much of my revenue and capital to the people who need it most, 
		and to the people whom I love most and changed my life forever, the orphans at 
		Forever Changed International.</p>
