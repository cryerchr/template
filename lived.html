		<h1>In the Future...</h1>
		<p>The name of this class is Science and Technology, and ironically, it is exactly
		 what opened my eyes to what I am going to do with my life.</p>
		 <p>This past summer I had the opportunity to take a life-changing trip to a less
		fortunate country than ours, Guatemala. Traveling to this country really made me
		get a grasp on life and what is most meaningful to me. Working with and 
		helping the people of Guatemala made me realize that I wanted to continue this
		type of work for the rest of my life.</p>
		<p>I was brought to this amazing opportunity by a medium inscribed on the 
		Internet, which only seems fitting to this class and more specifically this essay.
		One day as I was browsing the Internet I ran across a website called 
		foreverchangedinternational.org/ and instantly took interest in it. As I read 
		more and more about this orphanage I couldnâ€™t help but think about what my 
		parents have always taught me and realized this would be an amazing adventure. 
		I would be rewarded in ways far greater than the rewards for doing things for 
		myself. This trip would leave a lasting impact on my life and the way I would 
		choose to live my life from there on out.</p>
