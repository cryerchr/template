			<h1>Course Retrospective Essay</h1>
			<p>It is an understatement to say that this class was key. I say that, because 
its importance to success is so huge.  When you get to learn how to write in advanced 
settings, it really prepares you not just for your time at MSU, but also for the rest of 
your life. In essays where I was able to interview someone it gave me a first hand look on
 how much writing and research means in the business world. Even in positions other than 
those of the business field, it is really helpful to interview people. In Advertising 80% 
of the job is writing and brainstorming with peers on how to pitch something. That is 
exactly what this class expected of us and made us do. </p>
			<p>The remix project was different than all others because you were thrown 
into groups with people you don't even know and expected to collaborate and make a 
documentary exploring one of your first three essays. Lucky for me, my group and I agreed 
on a topic and ran with it. Being able to collaborate with others was something very 
useful that I Iearned through taking this class. These lessons will not leave me any time 
soon and I plan to use them in my career after school.</p>
			<p>My group and I did our project on the effects of sports on a college 
campus. Aside from just researching for the assignment and learning new facts to write 
about, I learned many things that I had never known about sports and how they make some 
students feel. I came to learn how sports directly impact students and the way they 
operate, even how much they are able or unable to do necessary things for school. I can 
give one example where a student was directly impacted on his studies due to sporting 
events, because the library happens to close on game day to prevent random entries into 
the schools library. </p>
			<p>This essay doesn't just help solidify who you are as a writer but it also 
gives you the chance to voice your opinions to your peers and also the professor. For 
example, in my cultural analysis paper I centered my essay around the idea that music and 
their lyrics can sometimes have negative affects on teens and their decisions. My key 
aspect was about the song, “Bandz A Make Her Dance” where “twerking” originates. 
“Twerking” is a dance that took over social media and mediums such as Vine that have 
helped the provocative dance get more and more popular.</p>
			<p>When I went through analyzing the direct effects of music and their lyrics,
 there were countless amounts of stories that talked about lyrics and how they get 
misinterpreted by teens and taken out of context and put into dangerous and vulgar 
situations. Thanks to this assignment I learned information about the affects of social 
media and had question occur about my own life that would have never occurred if it wasn't
 for this assignment.</p>
			<p>There isn’t much about this class that you could really change. The way the
 projects were set up was perfect. You started definitely with the easiest one so we know 
what to except out of the class and also what kind of work we were expected to produce. I 
love how we were challenged with a few very hard topics to write about such as the “Formal 
Research Essay”. It was never anything impossible but just stuff that was at the tip of 
the iceberg that made you think outside the box and search for things to say. The 
challenge definitely makes you stronger and a much better writer.</p>
