			<h1>Course Retrospective Essay</h1>
			<p>Lastly, I want to retrospect on the professor of the course. I am glad I 
took the 110 course instead of 150, because I was able to learn about coding alongside 
composing essays. Coming in I knew very little about coding, in fact, nothing! Thanks to 
the help of my peers and my professor I was able to learn a very beneficial tool in todays 
society. I loved how when I struggled, all I had to do was raise my hand, walk to the 
professors desk or just email her, and I got an answer then and their. Without her help, 
when I was stuck I may have just gave up. Luckily for me I was blessed with selfless peers 
and a professor that was always there to push me through the struggles and tuff aspects 
of the course.</p>
			<p>In conclusion I would like to restate what I have said throughout this 
entire essay that this class is so important and should never be taken lightly. If you 
properly learn how to write good and strong essays then you will be successful not only 
in this class but also in many of your other classes. I know this because I am also 
enrolled in History 213, which is a class with rigorous coursework and essays play a huge 
part of the class, in fact, 50%. So it’s nothing that should be taken lightly, and it’s 
because of this class that I have learned how to do proper research, and to write solid 
essays. </p>
			<p>I feel like I have said this repeatedly but, this class really makes you 
think. Each and every assignment I either learned something about people, society, and 
even myself. Starting from the first assignment I learned about myself in a sense of who
I believe myself to be. In the second Cultural Analysis essay I learned about how people 
act and how society deals with it. For my research essay I learned how in my major 
research affects it and how it can help your future in any career. Lastly, on the remix 
project I learned about the effects sports have on certain students. That's what its all
about. Yes, this class is about what you produce literacy wise, but its more than that. 
When your work gets you to think and to analyze numbers, people, and society it gives the 
class meaning. That is what taking a WRA class is about. When you come to notice that, 
that is when you will succeed not just for these 4 credits but for your life.</p>
