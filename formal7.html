			<h1>Formal Research Paper</h1>
			<p>Outside of research and writing there are many key traits and that you 
should possess to be successful, in the business academic discipline and your career that 
you take from it. There are thousands of people that share the same academic discipline so 
to be successful you have to be a personable and memorable person. Even in the academic 
setting it is very competitive. </p>
			<p>The Princeton Review says, “As a major in business, expect to work in small
 groups—no room for wallflowers here. Count on problem solving, theorizing, and math-heavy 
number crunching, too. You’ll have your choice of areas in which to concentrate; many 
colleges and universities require you to focus on one, while others allow you to sample 
several.” This is huge in the major because if you aren’t personable and not outgoing, 
you aren’t going to achieve what other groups that are personable achieve.</p>
			<p>On being memorable, it's a larger aspect when you are in your career but it 
starts while in the academic sphere. They say the classroom is your “first interview”. So 
why not be memorable? Being memorable starts with the way you present yourself and the way
 you look. In business you want to look professional. You want to come off as confident 
and calm. If and when you show nervousness, it shows weakness. When you calm, collective, 
and passionate that is when you get fellow students and employees to believe in you.</p>
			<p>Business may be different from other academic disciplines but in the eyes 
of many, it is in a positive way. I say this because you can never stop learning and a 
career that drives you to continue to research and learn makes for a better society. This
 makes businesses stronger, and it drives competition that keeps everyone on the edge of 
their seat. The drive to make the best for themselves and others is extremely important. 
If all academic disciplines include research as thoroughly and in depth as business than 
this nation would no longer be in a recession. Nobody would be content with just okay, 
with just a mediocre business and or career. Everyone would be driven to out do others 
and to betterment themselves.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, when in the business (more thoroughly marketing) academic 
discipline, rigorous course work is always to be expected along with research and writing.
 It doesn't stop there, just like how some kids feel the need to ask why they have to do 
calculus in a major that doesn't deal with that in the real world, business actually takes
 every trait and learning and incorporates in into the life students will have after there 
academics and into their career. That is why business men tend be successful, because all 
of the rigorous coursework in fact does affect your business and how you may see things 
in your career. On an end note, the emphasis of writing, reading, and researching, should 
never be overlooked, because its importance is far too great to be taken with a grain of 
salt.</p>
