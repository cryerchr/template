			<h1>Formal Research Paper</h1>
			<p>Have you ever tried reading a book without actually looking at it? 
Obviously, it would be impossible. Just as looking at a book is to reading it, researching 
and writing is to becoming a business major and pursuing a job in the business field. 
Researching and writing are two of the most important aspects of being successful in the 
business field. 
For those like myself that are new to academic discipline and this whole college thing, 
there is a lot to learn. Coming into college I thought I had a main idea about what I was 
getting into, but it turned out to be a lot more complex than I actually thought. 
Thankfully, I was born and raised into a family that took on the same discipline I have 
today when they were my age. Having a lot of business-oriented people in my family 
surround me has taught me a lot about what I need to know. Even though I am only 
eighteen, I feel as if I have a head start on others to the secrets of becoming a 
successful businessman in my near future. Having had various amounts of family members 
and close friends go down the business path, I became inspired to follow in their 
footsteps. </p>
