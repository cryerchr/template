+		<p>In Class Activity</p>
			<p> The purpose of the video was to get the story out about his uncle and his 
			views on homosexuality. He did a great job portraying his views to both people 
			that support that lifestyle and those that do not!</p>
		<p>In Class Activity 2</p>
			<p>Technology plays a huge role in  this century when it comes to 
			communication and writing. Everyone looks to social networks such as twitter
			and Facebook. The passion that Mark Zuckerberg had to create something 
			revolutionary really did change the world. Some would say negatively because 
			of how much we are consumed in social networks, but all in all for the 
			better.</p>
