			<p> The purpose of the video was to get the story out about his uncle and his 
			views on homosexuality. He did a great job portraying his views to people 
			that support both that lifestyle and those that do not!</p>

			<p>Technology plays a huge role in  this century when it comes to 
communication and writing. Everyone looks to social networks such as twitter and Facebook. 
The passion that Mark Zuckerberg had to create something revolutionary really did change 
the world. Some would say negatively because of how much we are consumed in social 
networks, but all in all for the better.</p>
		<p>In Class Activity 3</p>
			<p>In this activity we watched a commercial that had to do with some of our 
own hometown, Detroit. It was a Chrysler commercial that portrayed Detroit in positive way 
with uplifting beat, from the famous Eminem hit song. It gave the image of a roaring 
Detroit, a Detroit that is on its way back! The voice over gave the strong, uplifting, 
and confident feel, on the city as a whole and the quality of the car.</p>

wouldn't get smarter and learn new tools like I have already in this course.</p>
